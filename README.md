# Kaboom App #
Turn your favorite Kaboom.js game into a hit app on iOS and Android!

## How It Works ##

Kaboom To App is powered by [Expo](https://expo.dev), a modern library that allows users to build React Native apps fast! We installed a shell of an expo app, which can be later edited and converted to match your dreams.

## How To Use ##

To use the Kaboom App, follow these steps. Node JS <b>must</b> be installed (globally, preferably), along with npm:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Rename the `YourAppNameHere` directory to your app's name
3. Enter that directory with `cd`
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Copy and paste your Kaboom.js code into the `kaboomPlaceholder` file <b>below</b> the comment to `//put your kaboom code here`
6. Start the development server by running `npx expo start`.
7. Open the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your iOS or Android device.
8. Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or in the Expo Dev Tools.
9. Enjoy playing your  Kaboom.js game as a mobile app!

For customization of the app's name and icon, edit the `app.json` file. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/) to learn more about configuration of this file.
